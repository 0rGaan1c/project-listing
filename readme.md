# project-listing
- Developed a dynamic project listing application using the MERN stack, enabling users to register, log in, create, and edit products with ease.
- Implemented filtering and sorting features, allowing users to efficiently navigate through a wide range of projects.
- Incorporated a user-friendly interface that supports upvoting and commenting functionalities, fostering community engagement and collaboration.
- Ensured anonymity and privacy by designing the application as a single-user system, omitting the storage of user-specific data such as product creators, commenters, and upvoters.
